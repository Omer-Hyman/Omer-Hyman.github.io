      <p>
        I am a software engineer with 1.5 years of industry experience, a degree
        in Computer Science and nearly 10 years of development experience.

        Although not officially working as a software engineer since 2024, I
        have always been working on personal projects in my spare time. I love
        creating new products that I wish existed for my own personal use.

        While I have used a wide variety of different technologies, I always
        find myself coming back to full stack cross platform web development.
        More often than not, I am coding with React or Angular alongside
        Capacitor to build web based applications that run on Mobile, Desktop or
        the Web. Capacitor is really a powerful tool that allows me to use my
        web development skills to write a cross platform applications that have
        the chance to reach a wider audience.
